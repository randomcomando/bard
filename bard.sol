// 'BARD' Token contract
//
// Symbol        : BARD
// Name          : BARD Token
// Total supply  : 1000000000
// Decimals      : 18
// Owner Account : [owner account]
//
// (c) by {Debug_Hunters} 2023. The MIT Licence.
//
// BARD Token includes a taxation mechanism, where % of each transaction is 
// diverted to different addresses for various purposes such as liquidity, burning, 
// development, and marketing. This tax can be adjusted by the contract owner and 
// it's essential to be communicated with token holders clearly.
//
// The burn mechanism contributes to the deflationary nature of the token by sending
// part of each transaction to the burn address, effectively removing these tokens 
// from the total supply and thus increasing scarcity over time.
//
// The tokenomics model adopted ensures a fair distribution of tokens, with allocations 
// made for presale, marketing, development, and liquidity. This fosters a balanced ecosystem 
// in the token's economy.
//
// This contract includes various safety features including the Pausable feature, which 
// allows the contract owner to pause token transfers in the event of any suspicious activity, 
// thus providing an additional layer of security to token holders.
//
// Transactions from special wallets like presale, marketing, developers, and liquidity 
// wallets are exempted from tax to facilitate operational efficiency.
//
// All official BARD Token social media pages and website can be found within the contract variables.
